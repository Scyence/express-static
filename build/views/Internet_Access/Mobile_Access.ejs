Access your Camera through it´s DDNS Address</h3><p><i>Please read <a href="/Internet_Access/The_DDNS_Service/">Step I</a> on how to configure your camera and <a href="/Internet_Access/Port_Forwarding/">Step II</a> for the necessary router configuration first.</i><br><br>In the following we will use the web browser as well as the InstarVision smartphone app to access the INSTAR IP camera remotely.</p><p>Please open your camera´s Web User Interface and navigate to <strong>Network > DDNS</strong> (<a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Network/Remote_Access/">1080p Series</a> / <a href="/Web_User_Interface/720p_Series/Network/DDNS/">720p Series</a>). Copy your personal DDNS address into your browser´s address bar amd add your camera´s external port- e.g test12.ddns3-instar.de:8081. This address will guide you to your camera´s user interface. <strong>Some routers don´t allow you to use your camera´s DDNS address from inside your local network! (e.g. Telekom Speeport)</strong></p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:ddns_address_in_browser" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Internet_Access/ddns_address_in_browser.png" width="325" height="75" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><div class="margin"><p>To access your camera you can always use the same DDNS address. So if you have more then one camera you only need to remember one address. Most important is that you change the port behind the DDNS number. The reason behind it is that your internet service provider is assigning you a new IP address every 24 hours. Once the address is changed the camera notices this and sents it to the server in order to connect it to our DDNS address. This way you can always access your camera with one address even so the IP behind it changes. So even if you are using different DDNS addresses they all link to one address. So with every address you will access your router. And because of the port forwarding your router then knows to which device you want to be forwarded to. So for example we type the following to access the cameras:</p><ul><li>Camera 1: http://d2908.ddns-instar.com:8081</li><li>Camera 2: http://d2908.ddns-instar.com:8082</li><li>Camera 3: http://d2908.ddns-instar.com:8082 and so on...</li></ul><p><strong>Remark</strong>: It can take up to half an hour for your DDNS address to activate. If your connection fails, wait for 30min (restart your router as it might have cached the earlier failed attempt) and then try again.</p></div><div class="margin"><h3>InstarVision Mobile Apps</h3><p>To add your camera to our free mobile app InstarVision, use the network scanner to find cameras on your local network. Or open the DDNS menu (<a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Network/Remote_Access/">1080p Series</a> / <a href="/Web_User_Interface/720p_Series/Network/DDNS/">720p Series</a>) to scan your camera´s QRcode:</p><ul><li><a href="/Software/Windows/InstarVision/Windows_Phone/DDNS/">Windows Phone</a></li><li><a href="/Software/Windows/InstarVision/Metro/DDNS/">Windows 8/10 (Metro)</a></li><li><a href="/Software/iOS/InstarVision/iPhone/DDNS/">iPhone</a></li><li><a href="/Software/iOS/InstarVision/iPad/DDNS/">iPad</a></li><li><a href="/Software/Android/InstarVision/DDNS/">Android</a></li></ul></div><div class="dangercard"><h4>Caution:</h4><p>Whereas it is possible to test the DDNS access in a FritzBox of the same network, there are routers such as the <strong>Telekom Speedports</strong> which can deny the test. This means you would have to use a computer in another network, or alternatively test the DDNS-Access by using the mobile network on your smartphone.</p><p>It is not possible to use the DDNS-Service if you don´t have an IPv4-address. If you only have an IPv6-address, you can ask your provider to give you an IPv4-address.</p></div></article><amp-image-lightbox id="ddns_address_in_browser" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox></div></div> <% include ../_partials/content/_bluenav-general-mobile.ejs %><footer> <% include ../_partials/amp/_amp-footer.ejs %></footer></body></html>
