If you have a W500V Speedport router then you have to also choose <strong>Neues Gerät hinzufügen</strong> at NAT &amp; Portregeln so you add the camera as a new device in the router. Therefor you need to know the MAC address of your IP camera. You can check the cameras MAC address by opening the command line in windows which you find at "Start - Programs - Accessories - Command". This will open a small window in Dos Mode. Here you can simply type in "arp - a". This will list you all IP addresses that your computer is connected with including the MAC address. Search for your cameras IP and write down the MAC address of the camera. Now please go back in the Speedport router and add the device. All other Speedport routers normally do not need this setting.</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:Speedport1" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Internet_Access/Speedport1.jpg" width="797" height="556" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><div class="margin"><p>Go to Netzwerk/NAT und Portregeln to set a new port forwarding rule for your camera.</p></div><div class="margin"><ul><li><strong>Auswahl</strong>: Here please do not choose anything. Or you could choose "HTTP Server" which will use the default web port 80.</li><li><strong>Bezeichnung</strong>: Here please choose a name for the forwarding rule. For example "IP Camera" or "Instar".</li><li><strong>Gültig für Gerät</strong>: Now please choose the device name or the IP address of your IP camera. This should be the same address that you are using in order to open your IP camera in the web browser. Mostly this address should start with 192.168.2.x.</li><li><strong>Umgeleitete Ports - Öffentlich</strong>: Please choose 80 as your port. If you do not want to choose Port 80 you have to make sure that later when you try to access the camera that you also have to type in the Port in the address bar with ":" for example xxx.ddns-instar.com:87 in case you are using Port 87. Umgeleitete Ports - Private Client: As default you can fill in 80. If you are using InstarVision and you want to do Portforwarding to the integrated web server you also have to fill in 80 if you didn't change the Port inside the software.</li></ul></div><div class="dangercard"><h4>Note:</h4><p>If you are using a Fritz!Box or a Netgear Router you can test the connection from within your own network. Other routers - like certain models of the <strong>Telekom Speedport</strong> - do not support this function. So it is necessary to test it from outside your network. For example from a friends computer or from your computer at work. If you try this with Port 80 and you access your router instead of the camera then you might try to use Port 8081 since it could be that 80 is the service port of your router. If you are using a smartphone App you normally have to fill in the DDNS number instead of the normal IP address and also the Port through which you access the camera. You can also check the user manuals for our <a href="/Software/Windows/InstarVision_Windows-Phone">Windows Phone</a>, <a href="/Software/iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="/Software/Android">Android</a> App.</p></div><div class="margin"><h3>Telekom Speedport (900 Series)</h3><p>To access the user interface of your router open the following address with your internet browser <a href="http://192.168.2.1">192.168.2.1</a>. The default login can be found on a sticker on the back of the router. Navigate to the <em>Portfreischaltung</em> in the <em>Internet</em> tab. Click on <em>Weitere TCP Umleitung anlegen</em> and pick your cameras IP address from the drop-down menu. You can find your cameras IP address using our IP Camera Tool. Type your cameras port - the default port is 80 - into all 3 fields and click "Speichern" to save the service.</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:Speedport_01en" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Internet_Access/Speedport_01en.jpg" width="480" height="335" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><div class="margin"><p>Go to Internet/Portfreischaltung to set a new port forwarding rule for your camera.</p><p>Your camera can now be reached via the ddns address that can be found under System/Info in your cameras user interface (s. above).
