In case of an INSTAR HD camera you can also use the RTSP stream that is transported via a different port (default 554).<br/><br/>It is recommended not to open the default ports to the internet - as this can make your local network vulnerable against attacks. There is also a problem that default ports might be used by different services and not be available. Some internet provider even block all ports from 1 - 1024, forcing you to use a much higher port for your camera. Fortunately, there are plenty of ports to choose from - <strong>65536</strong> ( 2<sup>16</sup> ) to be specific. We recommend you try using a port that is bigger than 8080 - the last port that is regularly used by web based services. Please keep in mind that changing the default HTTP port of your camera forces you to add this new port to the IP address of your camera separated by a ":" if you want to access the web user interface with your browser locally - e.g. 192.168.178.199:<strong>8081</strong>. It might, therefore, be more convenient to forward the RTSP port instead and access the camera through our smartphone app as "RTSP" camera. This way you will not be able to access the cameras webUI - but this can be an advantage from a security point of view.</p></div><div class="margin"><h2>Fritzbox 7490</h2><h3>Set your Camera Ports</h3><p>First, take a look at your cameras HTTP and - in case of a HD model - RTSP port. As mentioned above, they can be changed to non-default port. Remember the port you have chosen and open your router in a new tab - the default IP address is 192.168.178.1, alternatively, you can type fritz.box to navigate to the user interface. The default login is username = admin and the password is provided on a sticker at the back of your FritzBox.</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_01" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Internet_Access/Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_00.png" width="482" height="599" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><div class="margin"><p>You HD cameras live stream is accessible via two ports that can be forwarded.

The default ports work most of the time - but if they don´t, it can be very difficult to figure out who the culprit is. It is best to choose a port outside of the regular range of web ports if you run into problems. Especially, mobile internet providers often block ports up to 1024 or even to 8080.</p><p>Mobile access points - <strong>3G / LTE</strong> routers that are operated via SIM cards - often do not provide a public IP address that is needed for the DDNS service. If you are using mobile internet and you cannot connect to your camera from external network, check if your contract offers a static WAN IP address. This is often provided with Business Packages but not available for lower priced contracts. A public address for your router is mandatory for the DDNS access to work!</p><p>Another problem are so called <strong>DS-Lite (Dual Stack Lite)</strong> connections - it is, in general impossible, to access your camera via DDNS if your provider assigns you a DSLite connection. You can check if this is the case by checking if you have an IPv6 address next to your normal IPv4 address <a href="http://www.wieistmeineip.de/">>>Click Me<<</a>.</p><p>The solution for both the missing public IP and DSLite tunnels is a new technology that was added to the HD camera line. All INSTAR HD cameras come with a <a href="/Web_User_Interface/HD_Series/Network/P2P/">Point-2-Point UserID</a> (P2P UID) that allows you to connect our mobile app to the camera without the need of a port forwarding. This technology will work behind mobile access points without a public IP as well as behind DSLite IPv6 connections.</p><p>Another Problem might be the parental control settings inside your router. Please check if your camera is allowed to connect to the internet in the Kindersicherung (<strong>Parental Control</strong>) section:</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_07" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Internet_Access/PC-Fritzbox-7490de_01.png" width="1000" height="617" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><div class="margin"><p>Click on Kindersicherung on the main page, or....</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_08" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Internet_Access/PC-Fritzbox-7490de_02.png" width="993" height="526" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><div class="margin"><p>...go to Internet/Filter and check if there are any restrictions active for your camera.</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_09" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Internet_Access/PC-Fritzbox-7490de_03.png" width="994" height="420" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><div class="margin"><p>If yes, click on the pencil button to lift the restriction (choose <em>Unbeschränkt</em>).</p></div><div class="margin"><h2>Adding More Cameras</h2><p>If you are using more then one camera you have to also create another Port rule for each camera.Please make sure that the <strong>Öffentliche Port</strong> is always different for each port forwarding. For example if you are using Port 8081 for the first camera then the second camera should have the Port 8082 and the third camera Port 8083 and so on.</p><p>To access each camera you would type in something like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Camera 1</strong>: ab1234.ddns-instar.com:8081</li><li><strong>Camera 2</strong>: ab1234.ddns-instar.com:8082</li></ul><p>and so on...</p></div><div class="margin"><p><u><strong>Note</strong>:</u><br/></br/> You can access all cameras with only one internet address. Only the Port at the end has to be changed. Therefore, you do not have to remember all DDNS addresses of the camera. You only need to remember one address.</p></div></article> <!-- ###################### Lightboxes ######################## --><amp-image-lightbox id="Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_01" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox><amp-image-lightbox id="Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_02" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox><amp-image-lightbox id="Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_03" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox><amp-image-lightbox id="Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_04" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox><amp-image-lightbox id="Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_05" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox><amp-image-lightbox id="Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_06" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox><amp-image-lightbox id="Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_07" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox><amp-image-lightbox id="Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_08" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox><amp-image-lightbox id="Portforwarding-Fritzbox-7490de_09" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox></div></div> <% include ../_partials/content/_bluenav-general-mobile.ejs %><footer> <% include ../_partials/amp/_amp-footer.ejs %></footer></body></html>
