The oldest recordings on the camera will then be overwritten by default.<br> <b>2.</b> We offer a <strong>Cloud</strong>-solution to easily storage the recordings of Instar-Cameras. The Instar-Cloud offers an easy-to-access surface and a good way to manage your recordings. If you are afraid that your camera and SD-Card could be destroyed, the Instar-Cloud will give you the means to safely storage your recordings.<br> <b>3.</b> You can use InstarVision 2.0, a <strong>Windows PC Software</strong> made by us. With this Software it is not only possible to show the live-video of all your cameras at the same time and to easily access them, you can also start recordings and save them on your computer.<br> <b>4.</b> It is also possible to use <strong>FTP</strong> (File Transfer Protocol) to send your recordings to other devices, for example to an USB-Stick connected to your router or a hard-drive in your network.<br> <b>5.</b> If you want to make permanent recordings you can also use <strong>NAS Systems</strong>, for example Synology or QNAP. These have their own surveilance software and can useinter the live-video of our cameras.<br> <b>Addition:</b> You can also activate the E-Mail-Service, then the camera will instantly after the alarm send you pictures of the Alarm-Recordings.</p></section><section><h3 class="cgi-accordion-header">+ Camera-Access via Smartphone-App</h3><p class="content">With our free App <strong>InstarVision</strong> for Android, iPhone, iPad & Windows Phone you can easily access the Live-Video of your IP-Camera. Moreover, you can access your SD-Card and check the recordings and use functions such as activating-/ deactivating the alarm or use the camera and smartphone as an intercommunication system.</p></section><section><h3 class="cgi-accordion-header">+ External Cables of the Outdoor-Cameras</h3><p class="content">Except for our FullHD-models, all of our cameras have a so called <strong>cable-tree</strong>, which consists of all cable-connectors of the camera. This cable tree is 80cm long and relatively thick. If you don´t want to drill a big hole in your wall, you can <strong>take off the cables</strong> of your camera and then put the thin end through the wall. A video-manual for how to do this you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxnCqE1YU0k">here</a>.<br> We strongly advice against cutting the cables, as you will not only lose the guarantee for your camera, you also risk irreperable demolotion of your camera. A solution would be to use a weatherproof cable-box to storage the cable-tree inside.</p></section><section><h3 class="cgi-accordion-header">+ Heater for the Outdoor-Cameras</h3><p class="content">If a heater is neceessary for your camera depends on the location. Our cameras can be used down to -5 Degree Celsius. If the temperatures get even lower, the camera will not get damaged. However, it is poosible that the camera will turn off and can not be accessed during the low temperatures. The installation of a heater would guarantee the permanent operation of the camera. You can find the internal heaters in our shop.</p></section><section><h3 class="cgi-accordion-header">+ Zoom-Lens</h3><p class="content">All of our HD- and FullHD-Cameras do not offer optical zoom, but digital zoom. However, due to their resolution our HD-cameras still offer a better quality with their digital zoom than our VGA-cameras with their optical zoom.</p></section><section><h3 class="cgi-accordion-header">+ Battery and/or SIM-Card</h3><p class="content">Our cameras do not have an internal <strong>Battery</strong>, therefore they must constantly be connected via power adapter.<br>Our cameras do not have a <strong>SIM-Card-Slot</strong>. If you want to use the camera at a location without internet access, you can use a mobile LTE-Router. The camera can then be connected to the router and will have access to the internet.</p></section><section><h3 class="cgi-accordion-header">+ Length of the Alarm-Videos</h3><p class="content">The alarm-video starts 3 seconds before the alarm event and ends 15 seconds after - in total the alarm video is 17-18s. If the momvement continues after the recording, there will be started a new recording.</p></section><section><h3 class="cgi-accordion-header">+ Time Lapse Recordings</h3><p class="content">With all of our cameras you can create time-lapse-videos, for example if you want to document the progress fo a construction site. In the WebUI (Recording -> Photo Series) you can set the order to take a snapshot in scheduled intervals which you can afterwards combine to a time-lapse-video. You can check <a href="/Software/Windows/InstarVision/Record/Photoseries">here</a> for more detailed information about setting your camera.</p></section><section><h3 class="cgi-accordion-header">+ Synology Surveillance Station and QNAP NAS</h3><p class="content">Synology and QNAP have their own surveilance software and can use the live-video of our cameras. All of our HD- and FullHD-Cameras are comaptible. For the implementaiotn of our cameras into their surveilance station you can follow our <a href="https://wiki.instar.de/Software/Other_Platforms/Synology/">manual</a>.</p></section></amp-accordion></article></div></div> <% include ../_partials/content/_bluenav-general-mobile.ejs %><footer> <% include ../_partials/amp/_amp-footer.ejs %></footer></body></html>
