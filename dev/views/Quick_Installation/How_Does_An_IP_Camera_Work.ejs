                <h1>How does an IP-Camera work?</h1>
                <div class="margin">
                  <p>An IP-camera is a complex product, however it is not complicated to operate one. In the following we want to give you an intorduction to the basic functions of an IP-camera. For even more information about our cameras you can continue reading the <a href="/Quick_Installation/First_Steps/">First Steps</a>, there we will explain more in detail how to use the camera.<br>
                  Now about the concept of our IP-cameras:</p>

                  <amp-img
                      on="tap:IN-8015HD2"
                      role="button"

                    <div class="margin">
                      <h4>What is an IP-camera and how does it work?</h4>
                      <p>The "IP" in IP-camera stands for "Internet Protocol". This implies that the camera is being connected with a network, from which it can be accessed by other devices. The access is not only possible within the same network, but even through the internet.<br>
                      Using our IP-cameras, it practically works like this:
                    <ul>
                      <li>You connect your IP-camera via LAN-cable or Wifi with your router. When your computer or smartphone is connected to the same router, you just type in the camera´s IP-address in the browser and you will access your IP-camera.</li>
                      <li>You can also remotely access your camera through the internet. This is possible via <a href="/Internet_Access/The_DDNS_Service/">DDNS-Adress</a> or via <a href="/Internet_Access/Point_to_Point/">P2P</a>.</li>
                      <li>When you access your camera, you will get to its <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Overview/">Web User Interface</a>. There you can see the current live-video and adjust settings such as alarms, schedules or video configuration. Those settings will be saved on the camera.</li>
                      <li>The camera is surveiling 24/7 and will alarm if something moves within the camera´s reach. How sensitive the camera´s <a href="/Motion_Detection/Setup/">alarm</a> is, and what happens after the alarm, you can individually set for your camera. Manual recordings following a <a href="/Motion_Detection/Alarm_Recording/">schedule</a> are possible as well.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>This is the basic concept of our cameras. For further information you can check out the  <a href="/Quick_Installation/First_Steps/">First Steps</a> or you browse our Wiki.
