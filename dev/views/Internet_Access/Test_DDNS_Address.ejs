                      <h1>Checking the DDNS address</h1>
                      <p>This step is very easy. Please open the web interface of your camera and click on Network - <strong>DDNS Service</strong>. Here you will find the <strong>Manufacturer Domain</strong>. This is the address with which you can access your camera over the internet. Remember this address! It normally consist of 4 letters and 2 numbers plus the server domain (e.g. ddns-instar.com). For example if it used the servers <u>xxxxx.ddns-instar.com</u> or <u>xxxxx.ddns-instar.de</u> then the "x" stands for the 6 letters/numbers. Please make sure that the third party DDNS is set to <em>None</em>. Now please click on <em>System - Info</em>. The DDNS Status has to be displayed as successful.</p>

                      <p>If in some case this DDNS address is missing in your camera please contact the INSTAR Support. If the status is unsuccessful, your camera might have a problem connecting to the internet. You can try restarting the camera and check its IP configuration - especially the DNS Server and Gateway. Please contact the INSTAR support team if the problem persists.</p>
                      <p>You can also check your DDNS address manually with a small program called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nslookup">nslookup</a>. Open your command prompt (in Windows: go to Start and type in <strong>cmd</strong>) and type <em>nslookup</em> to start the program. Now type in your DDNS address and wait for the response (see screenshots below). The IP address that is displayed has to be identical with the camera´s WAN IP address. You can check your WAN IP inside your router. Or open the website <a href="http://wieistmeineip.de/">wieistmeineip.de</a> and compare the displayed IPv4 address with the nslookup result.</p>

                      <p>In the third and last step we have to tell the router to which IP and which Port he has to connect if you access from the internet in order to access your camera. Therefor your have to set a rule in your router. In most routers this is called port forwarding but some other routers might name it NAT, Firewall or Port rules.</p>
                      <p>Each router also used different expressions for the settings. Our goal is it to make you understand the settings so that you can easily fill out your own routers information for the port forwarding. In our sample we use the AVM Fritz!Box again to show you how to set it. To open the router just use the IP address which we filled in as gateway above and open it in the web browser. You should now see the login screen for your router. In the Fritz!Box you find this settings by clicking "Internet" - "Portfreigabe". Normally all routers need the same following data:</p>

                    <div class="margin">
                      <p>If you want to set up more then one camera you have to make sure that for each camera you will create a port rule in your router. The external Port has to be unique for every camera. We recommend to increase the Port number by one. So first camera is using Port 80 and the second one should use Port 81 and the third camera Port 82 and so on. After you created the Port rule for each camera you should type in the DDNS address + the Port number. For example:</p>
                      <p><strong>http://xxxxx.ddns-instar.com:80</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="primarycard">
                      <p><strong><u>Excursus:</u></strong><br/><br/>To access your camera you can always use the same DDNS address. So if you have more then one camera you only need to remember one address. Most important is that you change the port behind the DDNS number. The reason behind it is that your internet service provider is assigning you a new IP address every 24 hours. Once the address is changed the camera notices this and sents it to the server in order to connect it to our DDNS address. This way you can always access your camera with one address even so the IP behind it changes. So even if you are using different DDNS addresses they all link to one address. So with every address you will access your router. And because of the port forwarding your router then knows to which device you want to be forwarded to. So for example we type the following to access the cameras:</p>
                        <p><strong>Camera 1: </strong> http://d2908.ddns-instar.com:80<br/><br/>
                        <strong>Camera 2: </strong> http://d2908.ddns-instar.com:8081<br/><br/>
                      <strong>Camera 3: </strong> http://d2908.ddns-instar.com:8082 and so on...<br/><br/></p>
                    </div>
                    <!-- /margin -->

                    <div class="margin">
                        <p><u>Note: </u>If you are using a Fritz!Box or a Netgear Router you can test the connection from within your own network. Most other routers do not support this function. So it is necessary to test it from outside your network. For example from a friends computer or from your computer at work. If you try this with Port 80 and you access your router instead of the camera then you might try to use Port 8081 since it could be that 80 is the service port of your router. If you are using a smartphone App you normally have to fill in the DDNS number instead of the normal IP address and also the Port through which you access the camera.
