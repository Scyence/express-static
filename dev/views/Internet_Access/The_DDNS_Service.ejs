                <p>In general we have to differentiate between two types of connections. One connection is the internal access which with we access the WebUI of the camera. This means that the computer as well as the camera are running in the same network and are most likely connected to the same router. You can then connect to the camera using the private IP address of the camera. The other connection is the external access to open the WebUI of the camera from outside your network. With this connection you can allow the access from anywhere in the world to your camera. No matter if you are sitting in the train using a smartphone or if you are on holidays using a laptop to access. To make this possible a few settings are necessary in the camera as well as in your router. This tutorial shows you step by step how to set up the external connection.</p>

              <h4>The basic concept of remote access</h4>
              <p class="intro"> There are two types of connections to your camera. The first type of connection is the internal access to get to the Web-UI of the camera. This requires, that the computer and the camera are in the same local network, connected by the same
                router. The second type of connection is the remote access, which allows to access the Web-UI of the camera through the internet from all over the world. Thereby it doesn´t matter if you´re sitting in the train using your smartphone, or
                if you are in your holiday resort using a laptop. </p>
                <p>Software-Ports are numbered connections, which are used by the computer to connect different types of network traffic. Services such as FTP on Port 21 or HTTP on Port 80 are already determined, many operating systems can even choose the right
                  ports for their respective services on their own. When a port in the router is being opened, a service will be assigned to that port, such as an IP-camera. For security reasons, all ports to the internet are closed in the router by default.
                  This is the reason, why you can not access your camera through the internet without port forwarding. To make this possible, there have to be applied some settings. In the following will be explained how to establish the remote access to your camera step-by-step.</p>

            <p>First of all, connect to your camera in your lcoal network. Then, in the Web-UI choose <strong>Network > IP-Configuration</strong> (1st Image: <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Network/IP_Configuration/" target="_blank">1080p Series</a> / 2nd Image <a href="/Web_User_Interface/720p_Series/Network/IP_Configuration/"

          <div class="primarycard">
            <p class="justify"><strong><u>Excursus:</u></strong><br/><br/>Please be reminded, that the first 3 numbers of the IP-address define the IP-area of the router. In our sample we used the AVM Fritz!Box, which uses the spectrum 192.168.178.X, and the Telekom Speedport
              from T-Mobile, which uses the IP area 192.168.2.X by default. Most other common routers such as TP-Link or others are using the IP area 192.168.1.x. The "x" can be a number between 1 and 256. All routers are usually using the number "1".
              In our sample above, we used 201 as the IP address for the camera. This avoids conflicts induced by the router´s DHCP Server. If the address is too low (for example 100), then the chance that the same number is given to two different devices
              is high (once by you and once by the DHCP Server). If you are experiencing troubles accessing the IP address of your camera, you might change the IP-Address and see if it works then. After you have set the IP address of the camera, you can
              then access it in any webbrowser and the web interface of the camera should open. It is necessay, that your device to access the camera is connected to your local network. If you don´t know the IP address of your router, you can check it
              in the MS-Dos Command window, by typing in "ipconfig", this will show you the computer´s and the router´s IP address.</p>

          <div class="dangercard">
            <h4>Trouble Shooting:</h4>
            <p>If the DDNS-Service in your camera is being displayed as "Not succesful", reboot your camera and check again, also check the settings applied in step 1. It´s possible, that it takes a while to establish the connection. If after one day there
              is still no connection, it might be possible that your internet connection doesn´t have an IPv4-Address. In that case you would have to use the <a href="/Internet_Access/Point_to_Point/">P2P Function</a> for remote access.</p>
